It needs divide data for learning from it.

01 Learn = Train <-> Test 
     Learn is making model to to understand the real.
     For use this knowledge in the real.

02 Learn = Train, Validate, Test
    01 Train 
    02 Validate that knowledge is trained.
         How to validate the knowledge =  It is trained or not with updating the model.
         Find out early stopping between underfitting and overfitting. (ex Frog in the wall)
         cross validation is recommanded. (ex One of 5 data set is randomly picked up for validation)
    03 Test that it is trained and validated.
         How to test the knowledge = It is is trained-validated or not with the last updated model.
         Apply this knowledge on different data.
    Train, Validate, Test is relative.
